TO DO:
- sliders for all constants: create initial loading system, scene is paused on loading the software, user interacts with sliders and changes constants, user presses play button, scene plays (ball falls)
- Calculates theoretical terminal velocity and compares to simulated terminal velocity at end
- more graphs: a/t, Fdrag/t, 

SLIDERS:
no point making the sliders update the values mid-fall: 
	- scene must be paused and must only play after user changes values with sliders. 
This allows:
	- actual scientific tests
	- comparison between initial analytically-calculated theoretical terminal velocity value compared to final numerically-calculated terminal velocity value at end of simulation.
HAVE PRESETS FOR REAL LIFE VALUES E.G.:
	- radius and mass: tennis ball, bowling ball etc
	- density of fluid: air, water, honey (the equation used to calculate drag is for low-viscosity fluids so keep this in mind)
	- acceleration due to gravity: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune... Sun?

CAMERA:
different preset cameras:
	- Whole scene
	- Follow ball
